This project is on the life of Michael Jackson and his rise to fame from the young age of 6 up until his death at 50. The King of Pop's career is arguably the most successful musical career in the industry. With that kind of fame, you're a hot topic around the world and you're certainly going to gain a lot of media attention. In this podcast, I will be covering how Michael Jackson was portrayed by the media throughout his life in the spotlight and to persuade people you can perceive people through the media but you really do not know someone until you meet them.
