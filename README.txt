Summary
	This project is on the life of Michael Jackson and his rise to fame from the young age of 6 up until his death at 50. The King of Pop's career is arguably the most successful musical career in the industry. With that kind of fame, you're a hot topic around the world and you're certainly going to gain a lot of media attention. In this podcast, I will be covering how Michael Jackson was portrayed by the media throughout his life in the spotlight and to persuade people you can perceive people through the media but you really do not know someone until you meet them. 

	As a fan of Michael Jackson's music from a young age to this day, his music lies close to me and my heart. Growing up listening to his music, it gives me a sense of nostalgia and home. I wanted to use the medium of an audio narrative to explore the life of Michael Jackson while also incorporating sound bites such as the 911 phone call made upon his death and background music that had similar sounds to his music.

	
	To engage the ongoing conversations about my topic, I discussed the way fame can be a negative in your life where people begin to make assumptions about who you are. I talked about how fans and tabloids made assumptions that Michael Jackson was gay to further prove my point. Throughout my time working on this project, I found my biggest challenge in finding background music to play because all of Michael Jackson's music was protected under copyright until the  2060s. Luckily, using Audacity was not too much of a problem because I have previous experience using the audio recording software. The feedback from my peers was very beneficial to my project with the encouragement of creating a connection to Prince and Michael Jackson as well as the great feedback on my audio assets.
